I made this as an exercise to get more familiar with C and as an opportunity to learn to work with SIMD instructions. It implements three image processing filters. Grayscale, sharpen and box blur.

It'll output 6 files using the filters. Once using C code and the other time using SIMD optimized instructions for each filter.

Use like so.
make box_blur
ffmpeg -i input.png -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb32 output.raw
./box_blur filename width height
ffmpeg -s 403x403 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb32 -i simd_blurred.raw simd_blurred.png
